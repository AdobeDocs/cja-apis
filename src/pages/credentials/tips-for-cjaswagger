description: Manage CJA connections through APIs

# Connections

The CJA Connections APIs allow you to retrieve connections programmatically through Adobe Developer. These APIs use the same data and methods that Adobe uses inside the product UI. See [Connections](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/overview.html) in the Customer Journey Analytics guide for more information.

The endpoints described in this guide are routed through analytics.adobe.io. To use them, you will need to first create a client with access to Customer Journey Analytics APIs. For more information, refer to [Getting started with the Customer Journey Analytics API](https://developer.adobe.com/cja-apis/docs/getting-started).

In order to view all connections, you must have product administration privileges associated with your account, as well as any other permissions required to retrieve CJA APIs.

Adobe may add optional request and response members (name/value pairs) to existing API objects at any time and without notice or changes in versioning. Adobe recommends that you refer to the API documentation of any third-party tool you integrate with our APIs so that such additions are ignored in processing if not understood. If implemented properly, such additions are non-breaking changes for your implementation. Adobe will not remove parameters or add required parameters without first providing standard notification through release notes.

This guide includes instructions for using the following endpoints:

* GET connection by ID: Retrieve a specific connection by connection ID
* GET all connections: Retrieve all connections for an organization
* GET backfills: Retrieve all backfills for a dataset and connection pair.
* GET data source types: Retrieve all data source types for an organization
