# Data groups

Data groups are the relative equivalent of connections in Adobe Experience Platform. The CJA API does not offer any way to create or modify connections directly; however, data views and components within data views rely on this endpoint to support their respective functions.

* See [Data views](dataviews.md) to learn how to create, edit, or delete data views.
* See [Dimensions and metrics](data.md) to learn how to view available dimensions and metrics within a data view.
