# Reporting API

The Reporting API lets you retrieve data from data views using Adobe Developer. Analysis Workspace uses the same API to retrieve and parse data, so any report available in Analysis Workspace is also available through the API.

You can call the `/reporting` endpoint to retrieve data using the API.

Adobe may add optional request and response members (name/value pairs) to existing API objects at any time and without notice or changes in versioning. Adobe recommends that you refer to the API documentation of any third-party tool you integrate with our APIs so that such additions are ignored in processing if not understood. If implemented properly, such additions are non-breaking changes for your implementation. Adobe will not remove parameters or add required parameters without first providing standard notification through release notes.
