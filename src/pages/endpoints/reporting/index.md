# Reporting API

The Reporting API lets you retrieve data from data views using Adobe I/O. Analysis Workspace uses the same API to retrieve and parse data, so any report available in Analysis Workspace is also available through the API.

You can call the `/reporting` endpoint to retrieve data using the API.
