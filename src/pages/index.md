## Overview

The Customer Journey Analytics APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to perform almost any action that you can perform in the user interface. Examples include the creation of connections and data views, retrieval of reports, and the creation of filters or calculated metrics. This documentation provides instructions on how to call Adobe's endpoints to return the desired data. 

This user guide assumes that you have an understanding of Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Experience Platform.
